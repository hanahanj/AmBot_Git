We board a single-engine sightseeing airplane. Wilson slips next to next to the pilot who is knowledgeable about the landscapes and cityscapes of the greater metropolitan St. Louis region that straddles the Missouri-Illinois line. Atiya sits in the back seat. Wilson is carrying photocopies of several maps of East St. Louis, one map of the city in the 1840s, another for the 1880s, still another for the 1900s, the fourth for the 1920s, and another for the 1950s. The two passengers see from the succession of maps depicting the expanding East St. Louis territory from the Mississippi River eastward, and the gradual transition from rural settlements to an urban center marked by streets, railroads, railyards, significant public buildings, and industrial worksites.

Up into the sky the plane heads west-northwest toward East St. Louis, roughly following Interstate Route 64. Once the plane levels around 3,000 feet over Fairview Heights, we begin to make out the Gateway Arch, the St. Louis skyline, and the Mississippi River gleaming in the sunlight. We pass over the bluffs marking the geologic boundary between the broken uplands and the flat terrain of the American Bottom. But though we near East St. Louis, there are no significant, recognizable markers lying against the flatness of the American Bottom. What markers exist are the trajectories and scars of the railroad tracks—with occasional curves but mostly rail-beds running straight as an arrow for miles. In the air, we can appreciate how the nearly unbroken topography of the area was attractive to railroads and industry. From here it is completely legible the ways in which the railroads shaped the development of East St. Louis.

We silently recall what we discussed of nineteenth-century East St. Louis. We know that city boosters, ambitious local politicians, land speculators, railroad managers, and others literally raised East St. Louis above the American Bottom floodplain, the relatively flatland with occasional small rises that lies between the Mississippi River and the nearby bluffs that marked the boundary between the floodplain and the uplands. These mid- and late-nineteenth-century city-builders believed future economic prosperity would arrive only completely capitalizing on the city’s location on the east bank of the Mississippi River, directly across the river from the metropolis of St. Louis, Missouri, to attract railroad commerce. 
			</p>

			<p>
No doubt nineteenth-century East St. Louisans believed they would conquer nature and economics under the right policies and conditions. Some inhabitants dreamt big dreams about their fledging city becoming the twin of St. Louis and an industrial powerhouse to rival Chicago in upstate Illinois. In the latter third of the nineteenth century, after much debate, sprinkled with the violence of gun battles, the city treasury dynamited, and the short-term phenomenon of dual municipal governments, the majority among civic leaders, industrial investors, and residents agreed to commence with the high grading project to raise railroad tracks and major thoroughfares above high flood levels and to construct flood control systems of levees and drainage canals. Through a variety of means, the high graders overcame their opponents, the low graders. High-grade advocates believed the combination of taxes and bonds to finance the trucking of earth and other material from the bluffs to the city was worth the effort to attract railroads and industries, and to stimulate rapid population growth. The low-graders feared the high graders would bankrupt the city. Low-graders’ fears proved unmistakably correct several decades later, but by then the city was hopelessly locked into a pattern of debt, heavy dependence on fickle industrial growth and output of extractive industries and primary manufacturers, and reliance on steady revenues from the many saloons and related entertainment establishments.

			<p>
Most importantly, in this natural history of a city, East St. Louisans placed their hopes and fortunes on railroads and industrialization and saw the Mississippi River not as an asset but as a liability that frequently bought ever-higher flood levels until by the 1910s flood control infrastructures finally blocked the river from spilling into the city.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
In our separate thoughts, we reflect on what we know of the industrial history of East St. Louis. The two had numerous discussions during their research on how the railroads significantly shaped East St. Louis’s traffic patterns, and how many city streets were built around the railroads. In some parts of the city, railroads chop streets and neighborhoods. Railroad companies found East St. Louis an attractive location across the river from St. Louis, and in the process turned East St. Louis into a railroad terminus and a national railroad node second only to that of Chicago in terms of size and activity. Railroads dominated the development of the city. Rail lines, railyards, roundhouses, work buildings, foundries, and warehouses once covered the riverfront. Some rail lines are multiple tracks; others are single track. Before the construction of bridges across the Mississippi, rail lines converge on East St. Louis from all directions except, of course, the west. Rail lines were laid before most streets were constructed. 
			</p>

			<p>
As for the street and traffic patterns, the streets that run from east to west (technically, northwest to southeast) are rarely interrupted or dead-ended by railroads. Whereas, the traffic on north to south (or really from northeast to southwest) streets are sometimes dead-ended by railroad tracks and now and then by industrial sites. Collinsville Avenue and State Street are among the few streets that do not follow the north-south or the east-west pattern straight lines.

A 1920s map East St. Louis shows the area along the Mississippi River thick with railroads and railyards. What remains? Traces of the rails and shadows of abandoned factories. Old industrial sites along the rail lines lying in ruin. For the most part, the massive railyards, industrial sites, and even homes between what used to be Main Street on the East and the Mississippi on the West, are gone. Erased. Some lie under the parking lots of the Casino Queen, while others were demolished with the construction of the Interstate system.

But more tellingly, nature has made quick work reclaiming the land, covering many acres in ruderal trees and undergrowth. Nature obliterated much of what people had built, rebuilt, or maintained from the 1840s into the 1970s. So much has been abandoned to natural processes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
How dramatic is this change from human attempts to impose order to the resurgent nature of the floodplane. What sharp and strange demarcations exist between the traces of industry and the emergence of lowland forests. This a landscape where the pretty and the ugly, investment and radical disinvestment, sit just next to one another.

One could say that the Metrolink station is on the southeast corner of what was once a flourishing downtown business district of East St. Louis. Some people might say, “What downtown business district?” And the question is a legitimate one after seeing vacant lots and abandoned buildings, several with ornate architectural details. Some folks with a comic bent upon observing trees and shrubs sprouting from crevices in the facades, on roofs, and through broken windows, can facetiously conclude that some of the abandoned buildings are oversized multi-tier tree pots, flower beds, and terraces of weeds and shrubs. Some would say, an outrageous experiment in wild urban greenery.

Surrounding the Metrolink station are a number of vacant lots that sit many feet below the sidewalk. These lots are examples of the high-grading that consumed much of East St. Louis’s energy and budget in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

			<p>
We begin our bike tour at the intersection of Missouri and Collinsville Avenue. This area was the center of the East St. Louis race riot of July 1917—a riot that I call a pogrom for its organized and intentional nature. According to the <em>1912 East St. Louis City Directory</em>, the local African American politician and dentist, Leroy Bundy, had his dentistry here at 327 Missouri Avenue. Black insurance agent and realtor Pearl Abernathy also had his office at the same address. The building is now the First Illinois Bank, but back then it was the First National Bank. Bundy commuted from his house at 1837 Market Avenue to his office here. 

			</p>

			<p>
East St. Louis was not totally racially segregated in 1917. Successful black business owners and self-employed professionals like Bundy and the lawyer and State’s Assistant Attorney Noah Pardon had their offices here in what was then a bustling downtown. I remember reading that at the beginning of the May 1917 riot several assailants stopped here in hopes of catching Bundy in his office. Fortunately, Bundy was not in his office, so the rioters left disappointed.  The July 1917 pogrom forced most black business owners to relocate away from downtown, and the city laid down strict residential segregation within months after the July riot. Much of the residential areas that the pogrom ravaged is now covered by highways, the Casino, parking lots, and the feral forest sandwiched between the highway and the river.

			</p>
			
			<p>
Why visit a place like this? Where the visible and tangible traces of history—however violent and terrible—are gone? What can we learn? Much of what might carry the traces of history—for example remains of streets, railroad sidings, and rail yards depicted on old maps—have been obliterated by time and nature. Much of the riot zone of the July 1917 riot has been erased by time, nature, and human agency. We would do well to speculate on the reasons for the abandonment and destruction of this significant tract so close to the river and in sight of downtown St. Louis.

There is a distinct feeling that pre-1917 black East St. Louis literally disappeared. The desire to find evidence of human habitation in the city can be frustrating as much of pre-1917 black East St. Louis north of Missouri Avenue disappeared during and soon after the July 1917 pogrom. They bike side by side because traffic was still light, remarking that this part of East St. Louis seems like a ghost town on Sunday morning. But then this part of North Third is flanked by the Interstate and parking lots. 

			</p>
			

			<p>
They remark that Third Street was part of the July 1917 riot zone. The July riot occurred along St. Louis Avenue both west and east of its intersection with North Third Street. the July pogrom centered around Third Street, Main Street, and Collinsville Avenue and areas bounded to the north by St. Louis Avenue, to the east by Sixth Street, to the south by Broadway, and perhaps to the west by Second Street. They bike along St. Louis across Collinsville Avenue with was also in the riot zone. They cross North Fifth Street, which by the way is now Metrolink train tracks, not a street, but this part of North Fifth Street marked the eastern limits of the riot zone. Interestingly, much of St. Louis Avenue from North Third to North Sixth is marked by vacant lots. 

			</p>
			
			<p>
Stopping in the middle of the wide open spaces of interstate on- and off-ramps, around 516 North Third Street, we are in the vicinity of the late Buddie Bell’s former house. Bell was a politician and philanthropist as well as a well-known saloon owner. His philanthropy was related to the fact that he was a bondsman, bailing people out of jail. What was his home like at the time? Was it fancy or well kept? While old photos show the simple homes of white and black East St. Louisans—low-income working people, living in shacks, hovels, without running water--we can imagine Bell living very comfortably. Rolling in dough East St. Louis Style—whatever that might mean or look like.

			</p>

			<p>
In the concrete slab foundations at 618 St. Louis Ave, we can read the trace of a building that was once there. Here was the home, perhaps also the office, of Lyman Bluitt—the black doctor whom the authorities considered one of the ringleaders of the black assailants during the July 1917 pogrom. We still don’t know what happened to Bluitt after his arrest. Two doors down, at 622 St. Louis Ave, is another concrete slab—the former site of the St. Luke’s African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
			</p>

			<p>
Did these structures survive that event? Whatever buildings were here are gone. But since when? The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or more recently? This is the story of any attempt to reconstruct history on the ground in East St. Louis: nearly everything we want to see is turning out to be empty fields, overgrown vegetation, ruins, foundations, and weeds.
partisan politics in the state.
			</p>

			<p>
On the site of the Best Market Place and Best Auto Place, at 232a North Fifth Street, was the office of the Afro-American State League of the State of Illinois. At least that’s the name printed in the 1912 city directory. We know it by the name the Afro-American Protective League of Illinois. The League was a civil rights and anti-lynching organization from the 1890s into the 1910s, and the League in East St. Louis had some high-powered residents like politicians Captain John Robinson and William T. Scott. 
			</p>	

			<p>
The Ainad Shiners Temple dominates the cityscape between the intersections of St. Louis Avenue and Sixth Street and St. Louis and Seventh Street. Did other large buildings stand at the intersection at one time, making the Temple not stand out from its neighbors?
			</p>
			
			<p>
The Ainad Shriners Temple was never integral to the history of black East St. Louis. But the Gompers Homes, though a white-only housing project when built, is part of the paradoxical history of black East St. Louis. The homes are named after Samuel Gompers, the first president of the old American Federation of Labor (now the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations—the AFL-CIO). The Gompers Homes were built by the federal government as a compromise to the city’s political leaders and real estate wheelers and dealers who were not thrilled that the government originally had planned to build a housing project for black East St. Louisans who had very limited opportunities to find decent housing because to extensive residential segregation. In keeping with a segregated mid-century East St. Louis, the government built the John Robinson Homes in a black neighborhood in the Denverside section of the city and built the Samuel Gompers Homes to house white families in what was then a white residential neighborhood. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
We might follow the line of argument that says the Samuel Gompers Homes desegregated in the 1970s when the city became a nearly all-black city.  But can we say that the Homes desegregated? Most white East St. Louisans left the city during the 1960s and early 1970s, leaving behind a residential vacuum that black people found the opportunity to fill. Taking a wider view, the East St. Louis region really remained segregated when you compare the city which is now nearly all-black to its neighbors that are predominantly or nearly all-white.

Goose Hill area was a black enclave before and after the July pogrom. Sited on the north edge of East St. Louis next to the meatpacking plants of National City, a once-vibrant section of the city has slipped forever into history. While a few houses still stand, much of the neighborhood has reverted to fields and undergrowth. Connected by a few streets to the rest of the city, Goose Hill is largely isolated, separated from the rest of the city by highways and railroads. While the housing west of Ninth Street looks like solid, affluent middle-class dwellings, residences—what left to human habitation—Goose Hill neighborhood strikes the visitor as the land that time has forgotten.

Well back at what would have been 2600 Piggott is the site of the old segregated McKinley elementary school. And here at 2600 Tudor would be the home of William T. Scott, the black politician who believed in swinging the black vote back and forth between the Democratic and Republican parties. Extremely active in politics and various organizations, Scott was one of the founders of the National Negro Liberty Party that ran candidates for national offices in 1904. Scott himself ran for President of the United States that year.
