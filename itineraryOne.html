				<p>This itinerary will explore Parks and Recreation in East St. Louis, specifically by directing you to four locations in the greater East St. Louis area and sharing parts of their geographical and social histories.   The State of Illinois authorized the creation of special taxing districts statewide for purposes of parks, forest preservation, and scenic byway protection as early as 1893.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legislation evolved over time, and by 1911, a state level park commission was created that spawned considerable park development across Illinois.
				</p>
				<p>
					While this action seems like one noble cause among many during the Progressive Era, it had political overtones.  Illinois has an individualistic political culture, according to Daniel Elazar, and this culture adds a corrupting “marketplace” what’s-in-it-for-me dimension to all of its politics.  It was the goal of many Progressive Era reformers to break up big-city power by creating boards and commissions.  However, in individualistic places like Illinois, it pushed the public’s business out of public view and these various boards and commissions became political pawns for patronage and corruption.  The Park District, the Levee and Sanitation District, the School District, and the Health District all became sources of political influence and proving grounds for city hall aspirants.  This is not to say that these districts did not do their jobs, and sometimes do them well.  In a famous bit of patronage, the Park District was pressured to give a job to Melvin Price, who would go on to be a long-term congressman from the area.  Price was hired as a lifeguard even though he could not swim.  Leaders defended their decision later by saying he was assigned to watch the kiddie pool, which did not require the ability to swim!
				</p>
				<p>
					Public parks played an important societal role at the turn of the last century.  Parks reflected a general value of nature and the respite a natural setting could give to residents.  Parks were a great equalizer, as they were open to all incomes and backgrounds (though, as we will learn later, parks were segregated too).  Industrial suburbs like East St. Louis saw the park system as a place of respite for factory workers and their families.
				</p>
				<p>
					The East St. Louis Park District was created in 1908.  It consisted of some or all of three townships (townships are the political subdivisions of counties):  East St. Louis Township (which was the city proper of East St. Louis), Canteen Township (the area north of East St. Louis, which includes the communities of National City and Washington Park), and Centreville Township (which includes the cities of Centreville, Monsanto/Sauget, and Cahokia).  You will be taken to four parks across the district.  Each park will be described by the geographic story of that particular parcel of land, the personal story of someone associated with the park, and the neighborhood story of the surrounding places.
