				<p>This itinerary will explore Parks and Recreation in East St. Louis, specifically by directing you to four locations in the greater East St. Louis area and sharing parts of their geographical and social histories.   The State of Illinois authorized the creation of special taxing districts statewide for purposes of parks, forest preservation, and scenic byway protection as early as 1893.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legislation evolved over time, and by 1911, a state level park commission was created that spawned considerable park development across Illinois.
				</p>
				<p>
					While this action seems like one noble cause among many during the Progressive Era, it had political overtones.  Illinois has an individualistic political culture, according to Daniel Elazar, and this culture adds a corrupting “marketplace” what’s-in-it-for-me dimension to all of its politics.  It was the goal of many Progressive Era reformers to break up big-city power by creating boards and commissions.  However, in individualistic places like Illinois, it pushed the public’s business out of public view and these various boards and commissions became political pawns for patronage and corruption.  The Park District, the Levee and Sanitation District, the School District, and the Health District all became sources of political influence and proving grounds for city hall aspirants.  This is not to say that these districts did not do their jobs, and sometimes do them well.  In a famous bit of patronage, the Park District was pressured to give a job to Melvin Price, who would go on to be a long-term congressman from the area.  Price was hired as a lifeguard even though he could not swim.  Leaders defended their decision later by saying he was assigned to watch the kiddie pool, which did not require the ability to swim!
				</p>
				<p>
					Public parks played an important societal role at the turn of the last century.  Parks reflected a general value of nature and the respite a natural setting could give to residents.  Parks were a great equalizer, as they were open to all incomes and backgrounds (though, as we will learn later, parks were segregated too).  Industrial suburbs like East St. Louis saw the park system as a place of respite for factory workers and their families.
				</p>
				<p>
					The East St. Louis Park District was created in 1908.  It consisted of some or all of three townships (townships are the political subdivisions of counties):  East St. Louis Township (which was the city proper of East St. Louis), Canteen Township (the area north of East St. Louis, which includes the communities of National City and Washington Park), and Centreville Township (which includes the cities of Centreville, Monsanto/Sauget, and Cahokia).  You will be taken to four parks across the district.  Each park will be described by the geographic story of that particular parcel of land, the personal story of someone associated with the park, and the neighborhood story of the surrounding places.

				<p>T
					his gigantic expanse, covering over 1,000 acres, has gone by three different names.  It was first acquired by the East St. Louis Park District in 1932 and called “Lake Park.”  At the time, it was the third largest municipal park in the United States.The Park District could not sustain the large park, and park improvements proved difficult.  In 1941, after a front-page story of the park appeared in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, a complaint was made to President Roosevelt that the park was nothing more than a sign of East St. Louis corruption.  By 1964, Lake Park was turned over to the State of Illinois.  The State renamed the park using the geographic area’s historic name Grand Marais (French for “large swamp” or “great marsh,” and often mispronounced “muh-RYE-ess,” leading to the frequent misspelling “Marias”).  The park was renamed Frank Holten State Park on May 1, 1967 after Representative Holten passed away.

				<p>
					One of the grandest events held here was the annual Lady of the Lakes Pageant.  Each October, a local beauty is chosen to lead this autumn festival, which included a ball at the Ainad Masonic Temple and performances on a lakeside stage.  An orchestra and choral groups performed, as did dancers.  Actors performed skits representing the history of Illinois.  Upwards of 10,000 people attended.  
				</p>

				<p>
					There are over 200 acres of water and five miles of shoreline.  There was an attempt to build a swimming pool in 1938, but the concrete cracked and the pool was deemed unfeasible and never opened.  Some say that pool was never opened since African Americans were demanding access to the new facility.

				<!-- <h1>Person</h1> -->

				<p>
					Frank Holten was the longest serving elected official in the history of the Illinois legislature.  He was first elected in 1916 and served until his death (at age 98) in 1966.  He was defeated in 1942 for only one term (by his Republican brother-in-law) and returned to office in 1944.  He was in the beverage business professionally and belonged to the Musicians Union, which he helped create, as a violinist.  He was an early voice for labor unions when there were few others in state government.  He supported the eight-hour work day and pushed for women’s right to serve on juries in Illinois.   He had only a sixth-grade education but was described as having a “winning personality” and a “knack for showmanship.” 
				</p>

				<p>
					He owned the Old Home Tea and Coffee Company and was quick to offer complimentary refreshments for church events.  His eight-piece band, formed in 1898, participated in public parades, performed at the Fairmont Race Track, and played at private parties.  He was remembered as never making rash promises, but saying “tell me what you want” and “I’ll try to get it for you.”   
				</p>

				<p>
					On his 95th birthday, President John F. Kennedy sent him a telegram, which said, “your nearly fifty years as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives is testimony to the high esteem in which you are held by the people of Illinois.”

				<!-- <h1>Neighborhood</h1> -->

				<p>This property is adjacent to the old Alcoa site, where Alcoa’s Aluminum Ore Company division operated.  The entrance of the site was off Missouri Avenue. The buildings are long gone.  Directly across the street from the Alcoa site was the Alton and Southern Railroad, which was Alcoa’s railroad for hauling its products and fuel.  Aluminum Ore was the largest employer in the area.  There was a large refinery here for bauxite ore and a factory that made aluminum kitchenware.  

				</p>

				<p>
					This area is outside of the East St. Louis city limits.  This was a strategy of many industries—locate around East St. Louis but not in it.  East St. Louis had a large population and needed to tax for the services required by that population—schools, parks, public health, etc.  By locating outside the city limits, large factories could tap the labor pool without having to finance city operations.  The profit margins at these factories were very low, and the wages were low.  Corruption was common.  The plant site is in the city of Alorton, which is derived from the words ALuminum ORe TOwN.  Sadly, the cities of East St. Louis and Alorton struggle with corruption to this day.
  
				</p>

				<p>
					The Aluminum Ore plant was at the root of a tragic historical event.  The 1917 Race Riot (probably the bloodiest riot in the United States).  Labor unions were for whites, and white workers went on strike over wages.  African Americans were recruited from Southern cities to come north and work at the factory.  Having lived the sharecropping life, these workers were thrilled to earn a fraction of the wages being pursued by the strikers and they had no idea the conditions under which they were arriving.  On July 2, 1917, inflammatory speeches were made at a great meeting in the Labor Temple on Collinsville Avenue.  White workers poured out of the building and marched in military formation down Collinsville Avenue to Broadway, where innocent blacks were accosted.  Whole neighborhoods were burned and there were many lynchings.  The official death toll was 39 blacks and nine whites, but the real toll was probably over 100.
				</p>

				<p>
					The plant began to downsize in the late 1950s, and was closed in the early 1960s.  Unfortunately, years of bauxite refining at the Aluminum Ore plant took an environmental toll on Holten Park.  According to the EPA, Alcoa dumped refining waste materials into the lakes at various points during the 20th century—likely beginning before it became a park.  Dikes attempted to hold the waste were breached.  In 2014, Alcoa began clean-up of the site under EPA supervision.
