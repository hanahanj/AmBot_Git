					What is the horizon of town-ness? Is it a social bond between people? Is it a territorial demarcation of incorporation? Is it a common set of values shared by citizens and government alike? The company towns of the American Bottom challenge many of the longstanding assumptions that we bring to our understanding of a town.
				</p>

				<p>
					This itinerary seeks to tell an urban/political/ecological/social history of the American Bottom through the seven company towns that were chartered here in its industrial height. It theorizes a broader landscape of division.
				</p>

				<p>
					Marking one of the densest clustering of company towns in the country, the portion of the American Bottom lying directly East of St. Louis is home to seven distinct pairings of industry and municipality. Chronologically, these pairings are as follows: Granite City/National Enameling and Stamping Company (NESCO); National City/ National Stockyards Corporation; Hartford/ International Shoe; Wood River/ Standard Oil; Roxana/ Shell Oil; Monsanto Town (now Sauget)/ Monsanto; Alorton/ Aluminum Corporation of American (ALCOA).
				</p>

				<p>
					The slaughterhouses of National City, the paternalistic industrial planning of Granite City, and the refinery landscapes of Wood River and Roxana, all gave rise to specific urban forms and social patterns that we can read as the surplus or externalization of the growth and development of St. Louis proper.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the incorporation, dis-incorporation, and afterlife of company towns in the American Bottom, we can read narrative of civic and social responsibility that is often at odds with the industrial imperatives of the time. If there was a shared attitude toward extraction, production, and capitol accumulation, then the sharp discontinuities and spatial fragmentation speak to the limitations of industrial production to address civic and social concerns. This itinerary will attempts to develop a synthetic language—both visually and written—through which we can begin to interpret this episodic landscape.

					This attitude can perhaps be understood as a symptom of the so-called Theory of Two Civilizations—the theory that, prior to exploration and inhabitation by Europeans in historic time, there must have been two distinct epochs of human habitation of the Continent. The inability of a European settler consciousness to imagine and accept the Mounds as a product of the indigenous peoples or their immediate forbears led not a few to posit an “Extinct Race”<sup>3</sup> of people that inhabited the territory and left these material traces of their civilization. Yet then there are others, for whom the Mounds display little more than an innate animal consciousness. Lucien Carr, a significant figure in turn of the century archeology and Assistant Curator of the Peabody Museum of American Archeology and Ethnology, somewhat apologetically writes: “as a matter of fact, the ant hills of Africa, in point of relative size, and in the architectural knowledge and engineering skill displayed in their construction, are quite equal to any earth-work in the Ohio Valley.”<sup>4</sup>
				</p>
				<p>
					Where, then, is the threshold for mound-ness to be found? As an early geologist of the Mound groups of the American Bottom noted in 1922: “Practically all of the mounds which are large enough to attract attention have a distinct artificiality in their regularity of form and steepness of slope.”<sup>5</sup> Which is to say, in the eye’s catalog of forms, it is a particular angle of repose, a ratio of figuration, which enters a mound into the field of the remark-able. But when compared to the complexes that enliven a kind of global pyramid consciousness, what distinguish this mound group are its blunt, earthen edges. Rather than the sharp stonework of the Temple of the Sun and Moon, Monk’s Mound is constructed entirely of dirt and is currently covered in a wooly sheet of grass and weeds. The mounds surrounding the main ceremonial center are likewise carpeted in turf and most distinctly enter the field of legibility immediately following their bi-weekly lawn mowings. It is in this bright line of demarcation, in the contour and mowing decision of the maintenance crew, that Cahokia reaches its architectural apotheosis.

					What do we get by following the piles? By attending to this base ordering of matter? It is my belief that there is a counter historiography that can be written that traces the mound as the originary architectural gesture. A mark with meaning. An alternate tectonic myth grounded in the recognition of earth out-of-place.  Adolph Loos, in recognizing the unadorned, psychological power of the mound, writes: “When walking through a wood, you find a rise in the ground, six foot long and three foot wide, heaped up in a rough pyramid shape, then you turn serious, and something inside you says: someone lies buried here. <em>That is architecture</em>.”<sup>6</sup> Architecture as a recognition of matter out-of-place; of matter in particular arrangement; of an affective register of arrangement.

				<p>
					But for every pile, there is a pit. And we would do well to not let the formal legibility of the mound distract us from the fundamental transactional economy in this (dis)ordering of matter. Lewis Mumford, that scion of urban meta-narratives, reminds us that the quarry pit is characteristic of the process of <em>Abbau</em>, or un-building: “What is taken out of the quarry or pithead cannot be replaced.”<sup>7</sup> But what if we dispense with Mumfords moralizing and instead cast the mound as a transitional object. As the becoming-city.
					
				</p>

				<p>
					But perhaps our mounds are no less enigmatic. After all, who, really, can account for the otherworldly, colorful mound sitting across the river just south of the gateway Arch? That reliable sources tell me it is a heap of the residue left after the burning of coal does not explain the range of reds, browns, blues, and yellows that marble its surface—let alone begin to answer what it is doing in the floodable part of the floodplain. I have revisited this mound dozens of times, and each visit reveals a new silhouette, a new stratum, a new rent carved by the most recent rain or flood.
				</p>

				<p>
					I know all the constituent parts of this mound—the Fe, the O2, the Pb. I will never understand this mound.
				</p>

				<p>
					It eludes me in its significance.

					Adjacent to the baseball diamond and park structures of the South Roxana Dad’s Club Park sits the last remaining intact mound of the Grassy Lake Site. Standing on the west edge of the park, along Old Edwardsville Road, you can discern a distinct topographic rise—running NW-SE—on which the mound is situated. This rise is part of the Wood River Terrace, which formed the northeastern edge of the former Grassy Lake. Like many of the other American Bottom clusters this is a lacustrine mound group, positioned adjacent to a water body formed from a former channel of the Mississippi. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Identified as Mound #10 in archeological reports, this mound was on the south end of a string of mounds that were located along the Wood River Terrace reaching up to the present day Refinery Museum. Unlike the Cahokia, St. Louis, East St. Louis, and even Pulcher sites, this northern group was not situated near any heavily trafficked Colonial era trails and roads. As such, it remained un-remarked upon for longer than many of the mound groups. Interestingly, the first known description of these mounds comes to us from William Clark—who explored the area in the winter leading-up to the great Army Exploration known as the Lewis and Clark expedition. Departing the winter Camp Du Bois at the mouth of Wood River on a cold January 9, 1804, Clark traveled east across the icy bottomland where he “discovered an Indian Fortification”. He continues: “In this fortress is 9 Mouns forming a circle two of them is about 7 foot above the leavel of the plain on the edge of the first bank and 2 M from the Woods & about the Same distance from the main high land” [sic].

				<p>
					Beginning in 1976, the new owners began crushing the slag material to use as fill and leveler to facilitate intermodal operations on the site. Based on an EPA study, there is an average of 3.5’ of this ground slag material spread across the 90 acres of the site. Additionally, this material was trucked offsite to be used a fill and base material for road and building site projects—leading to an unknown spread of the contaminated material into the surrounding communities.

					Travelers heading east across the Mississippi from St Louis would be forgiven for confusing the Cahokia Mound complex with its much larger cousin—the Milam Landfill. Situated less than 3 miles away and due west of Monk’s Mound—directly on the path of the setting sun—this modern-day mound is still in the process of construction. Receiving waste from across the St. Louis metro region and from sites as far away as Iowa and Indiana, Milam is the shadow impulse of mound-building writ large across the 20th century industrialized landscape of the American Bottom.

				</p>

				<p> 
					Landfill not simply as midden heap, but as oracular assemblage. Composed of offerings from hundreds of miles distant.

					Driving along Collinsville Rd. adjacent to Fairmont City you are occupying the edge of the former Indian Lake. To the North, one can detect a noticeable drop in grade—with the marshy lowlands of the lake-bed still legible between the trees and reeds. Here, along this small ridge adjacent to the former lake, was a string of Indian mounds—Powel, Wilson, and Sam Chucallo Mounds.

				</p>

				<p> 
					Taking their cues from the natural topographic rise, pre-contact Natives sited a series of burial and other mounds on land held up out of the flood prone area. In this, we can detect a fundamental human pattern of site selection. No one, ever, it seems, likes to build in swampy areas.
