				Yet the construction of mounds continues. Mound building has, if anything, even increased. While the civic and cosmic ordering that animated so much of the Mississippian era mound builders has, in this new era of mound building, been sidelined for the logistical and the proximate, our mounds index a way-of-being no less profoundly than the artifacts of the mind builders of pre-history. Slag heap, salt dome, aggregate piles, landfill, mulch mound—these are the forms of our cosmologies. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Which is to say, in landscape, it all matters. It all has meaning.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is an itinerary of <em>Significant and Insignificant Mounds of the American Bottom</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is oriented to an intentional flattening of signification—where meaning mingles uneasily with form. It puts us in proximity of meaning, without being identical to it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The provenance of the pre-contact mounds, however, has not always been so clear. Up until the early 20th century, it was common enough to find, in scholarly reviews and articles, suggestions and arguments as to the natural origin of the mounds. It was as if the ideological barriers to accepting the creative and constructive capacity of pre-contact Native Americans was too great an intellectual burden for anthropologists to bear. As only one example, we might cite the paper titled “Origin of Monks Mound,” given in Philadelphia at the 1914 Geological Society of America meeting by Dr. A. R. Crook, in which he writes: “It may be well to inquire if all so-called mounds in the Mississippi Valley are not natural topographic forms.”<sup>1</sup> And where, 8 years later, he recapitulates, in no less an authority than the celebrated journal Science, the the position that a recent study “establishes, beyond doubt, that [Monks Mound] is not of artificial origin, as has been so generally held but that it is a remnant remaining after the erosion of the alluvial deposits, which at one time filled the valley of the Mississippi, in the locality known as the “Great American Bottoms.”<sup>2</sup> Wind-blown piles of loess; aggregated sediment from eddying currents of the river; or simply the remainder of even-larger mounds eroded by the regular flooding of the Mississippi—the theories of the Mounds origins seem to more easily imagine a natural world full of creative agency than a native peoples summoning of order and meaning.

				This attitude can perhaps be understood as a symptom of the so-called Theory of Two Civilizations—the theory that, prior to exploration and inhabitation by Europeans in historic time, there must have been two distinct epochs of human habitation of the Continent. The inability of a European settler consciousness to imagine and accept the Mounds as a product of the indigenous peoples or their immediate forbears led not a few to posit an “Extinct Race”<sup>3</sup> of people that inhabited the territory and left these material traces of their civilization. Yet then there are others, for whom the Mounds display little more than an innate animal consciousness. Lucien Carr, a significant figure in turn of the century archeology and Assistant Curator of the Peabody Museum of American Archeology and Ethnology, somewhat apologetically writes: “as a matter of fact, the ant hills of Africa, in point of relative size, and in the architectural knowledge and engineering skill displayed in their construction, are quite equal to any earth-work in the Ohio Valley.”<sup>4</sup>
			</p>
			<p>
				Where, then, is the threshold for mound-ness to be found? As an early geologist of the Mound groups of the American Bottom noted in 1922: “Practically all of the mounds which are large enough to attract attention have a distinct artificiality in their regularity of form and steepness of slope.”<sup>5</sup> Which is to say, in the eye’s catalog of forms, it is a particular angle of repose, a ratio of figuration, which enters a mound into the field of the remark-able. But when compared to the complexes that enliven a kind of global pyramid consciousness, what distinguish this mound group are its blunt, earthen edges. Rather than the sharp stonework of the Temple of the Sun and Moon, Monk’s Mound is constructed entirely of dirt and is currently covered in a wooly sheet of grass and weeds. The mounds surrounding the main ceremonial center are likewise carpeted in turf and most distinctly enter the field of legibility immediately following their bi-weekly lawn mowings. It is in this bright line of demarcation, in the contour and mowing decision of the maintenance crew, that Cahokia reaches its architectural apotheosis.

				What do we get by following the piles? By attending to this base ordering of matter? It is my belief that there is a counter historiography that can be written that traces the mound as the originary architectural gesture. A mark with meaning. An alternate tectonic myth grounded in the recognition of earth out-of-place.  Adolph Loos, in recognizing the unadorned, psychological power of the mound, writes: “When walking through a wood, you find a rise in the ground, six foot long and three foot wide, heaped up in a rough pyramid shape, then you turn serious, and something inside you says: someone lies buried here. <em>That is architecture</em>.”<sup>6</sup> Architecture as a recognition of matter out-of-place; of matter in particular arrangement; of an affective register of arrangement.

			<p>
				But for every pile, there is a pit. And we would do well to not let the formal legibility of the mound distract us from the fundamental transactional economy in this (dis)ordering of matter. Lewis Mumford, that scion of urban meta-narratives, reminds us that the quarry pit is characteristic of the process of <em>Abbau</em>, or un-building: “What is taken out of the quarry or pithead cannot be replaced.”<sup>7</sup> But what if we dispense with Mumfords moralizing and instead cast the mound as a transitional object. As the becoming-city.

			</p>

			<p>
				But perhaps our mounds are no less enigmatic. After all, who, really, can account for the otherworldly, colorful mound sitting across the river just south of the gateway Arch? That reliable sources tell me it is a heap of the residue left after the burning of coal does not explain the range of reds, browns, blues, and yellows that marble its surface—let alone begin to answer what it is doing in the floodable part of the floodplain. I have revisited this mound dozens of times, and each visit reveals a new silhouette, a new stratum, a new rent carved by the most recent rain or flood.
			</p>

			<p>
				I know all the constituent parts of this mound—the Fe, the O2, the Pb. I will never understand this mound.
			</p>

			<p>
				It eludes me in its significance.

				Adjacent to the baseball diamond and park structures of the South Roxana Dad’s Club Park sits the last remaining intact mound of the Grassy Lake Site. Standing on the west edge of the park, along Old Edwardsville Road, you can discern a distinct topographic rise—running NW-SE—on which the mound is situated. This rise is part of the Wood River Terrace, which formed the northeastern edge of the former Grassy Lake. Like many of the other American Bottom clusters this is a lacustrine mound group, positioned adjacent to a water body formed from a former channel of the Mississippi. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Identified as Mound #10 in archeological reports, this mound was on the south end of a string of mounds that were located along the Wood River Terrace reaching up to the present day Refinery Museum. Unlike the Cahokia, St. Louis, East St. Louis, and even Pulcher sites, this northern group was not situated near any heavily trafficked Colonial era trails and roads. As such, it remained un-remarked upon for longer than many of the mound groups. Interestingly, the first known description of these mounds comes to us from William Clark—who explored the area in the winter leading-up to the great Army Exploration known as the Lewis and Clark expedition. Departing the winter Camp Du Bois at the mouth of Wood River on a cold January 9, 1804, Clark traveled east across the icy bottomland where he “discovered an Indian Fortification”. He continues: “In this fortress is 9 Mouns forming a circle two of them is about 7 foot above the leavel of the plain on the edge of the first bank and 2 M from the Woods & about the Same distance from the main high land” [sic].

				Beginning in 1976, the new owners began crushing the slag material to use as fill and leveler to facilitate intermodal operations on the site. Based on an EPA study, there is an average of 3.5’ of this ground slag material spread across the 90 acres of the site. Additionally, this material was trucked offsite to be used a fill and base material for road and building site projects—leading to an unknown spread of the contaminated material into the surrounding communities.

				Travelers heading east across the Mississippi from St Louis would be forgiven for confusing the Cahokia Mound complex with its much larger cousin—the Milam Landfill. Situated less than 3 miles away and due west of Monk’s Mound—directly on the path of the setting sun—this modern-day mound is still in the process of construction. Receiving waste from across the St. Louis metro region and from sites as far away as Iowa and Indiana, Milam is the shadow impulse of mound-building writ large across the 20th century industrialized landscape of the American Bottom.

			<p> 
				Landfill not simply as midden heap, but as oracular assemblage. Composed of offerings from hundreds of miles distant.

				Driving along Collinsville Rd. adjacent to Fairmont City you are occupying the edge of the former Indian Lake. To the North, one can detect a noticeable drop in grade—with the marshy lowlands of the lake-bed still legible between the trees and reeds. Here, along this small ridge adjacent to the former lake, was a string of Indian mounds—Powel, Wilson, and Sam Chucallo Mounds.

			</p>

			<p> 
				Taking their cues from the natural topographic rise, pre-contact Natives sited a series of burial and other mounds on land held up out of the flood prone area. In this, we can detect a fundamental human pattern of site selection. No one, ever, it seems, likes to build in swampy areas.

				Powel Mound was of particular interest to early archeologists—as it *****. Yet the relentless mound-removal of the 19th and 20th centuries left this large tumuli flattened. Today, its site is marked, we might say, by the itinerant businesses that inhabit the large strip mall at the corner NorthEast corner of Collinsville Rd., Kingshighway, and State Route 111.

				Adjacent to one of Fairmont City’s most popular Mexican restaurants sits the Sam Chuallo Mound. Named after the early 20th century landowner whose personal perseverance preserved the mound, the mound is part of the distributed State Park system. In a technique common through the area, the mound is contained in a low chain-link fence. It is as if the vital, chthonic energies that inhere in the mound must be caged. 
			</p>

			<p> 
				This string of mounds help remind us that mound-building practices extended well throughout the bottoms—following, usually, certain low-lying water bodies that would have provided easy access to fish and waterfowl.

				The mounds of Cahokia are some of the few remaining mounds in the region that survived the massive 19th and 20th century industrialization of the floodplain. The region was historically scattered with such monuments, but their consolidated earthen forms proved too alluring for developers and municipalities eager for fill-material—and they were scrapped and carted away to build the cities and roads—such as the one that bisects the site today. 
			</p>

			<p> 
				The network of hundreds of mounds were seen, by an enormously ‘productive’ and aggressive anglo-settler population, as ready fill material for the railroads and towns and building sites that were elevated above the flood plane by excavating and reallocating the earth from the mounds. These mounds were artifacts that were both celebrated and erased simultaneously—in what contemporaneous authors described as capitalism’s cycle of creative destruction. Mounds were leveled. Factories were built. Roads and buildings were named after the mound features they replaced. With this, 90% of the mounds and the immediately visible traces of Cahokian era settlement were erased. Seemingly.

				Throughout the 19th century, the yearly freshets that over-topped the natural levees of the Mississippi river and the bottomland creeks regularly visited the growing industrial communities of the American Bottom. At the time, lifting the grade of entire cities was argued, as it is in the above excerpt, as “the only thing that will save East St. Louis and the American Bottom.” And with the passage of the High-Grade act in 1879, 1’-12’ of fill were redistributed across the entire territory of East St. Louis and what was then National City. In parallel with this massive earth-moving effort, it was thought, any of the remaining evidence Mississippian era settlement was forever erased. But this is not entirely the case. The paradox of the high grade is that, as it dismantled the above-grade mounds in favor of a tabula rasa, it buried the remains of entire Cahokian villages under many feet of fill--preserving these everyday vestigase from the many building projects on the surface.
			</p>

			<p> 
				Additionally, the Cahokia mound group itself has undergone a number of shocking and ignoble re-inhabitations—first as the site of a Trappist monastery (from which Monk’s Mound gets its name), and subsequently as a drive-in movie theater and the site of a large 1950’s tract-home subdivision.

				In the 1980s, the state of Illinois began to purchase the land under this subdivision and drive-in. While the buy-out stopped short of explicitly invoking eminent domain, there remain numerous holdouts to the expanded aspirations of the State Park. Over the next decade, state park and preservation groups scraped clear most signs of the homes and infrastructure that once inhabited the cosmic axis, and initiated the carpeted lawn planting scheme seen today. 
			</p>

			<p> 
				In discussion with the State of Illinois Extension Agency, archeologists and geologists decided on a Brome Grass as the choice specimen for exclusive and extensive propagation. The plantings they chose had to walk a fine line of stabilizing the earth while not having an intrusive root system that might disturb artifacts buried below. Trees, for the archeologist, carry the threat of loss of information—as their root growth scrambles the layers and material that makes excavation legible. Much more promising for is a parking lot. 
			</p>

			<p> 
				Such is the paradox of preservation. 
			</p>

			<p> 
				As one of the site managers noted, in an offhand comment, how, for an archeologist working in this area, sometimes the presence of a large parking lot is the strongest promise for the preservation of artifacts below. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Yet beneath the neatly trimmed grass of the State Park and between the park-like distribution of mature trees, one can still discern the pattern of sidewalks, power-poles, and house-lots that once delineated this site. Descending the XXXX steps of Monks Mound, crossing Collinsville Ave, and continuing south along the central axis of the park, the visitor can here pick out the distinct crown of mid-century road construction. In place of curb and gutters are shallow ditches, still carrying away surface water to the sunken borrow pits further to the south. And in a sort of double cosmic retribution, or an ecumenical nod to preservation’s contracting horizon, a single, green-vinyl-sided tract home remains. Perhaps it is here, in the constellation of prehistoric mounds, industrial landfills, and post-war housing, that preservation can ask its most potent, and troubling, questions.

				Composed primarily of a byproduct of the extraction of alumina during bauxite refining is known as Red Mud. After further processing, this residue is called ‘Brown Mud’ The Red Mud is a fine grained clay/silt material and has the unique characteristic of being a semi-solid—a material that liquefies and thins when shaken, agitated, or stressed. Geologists and seismologists know this response to perturbation as <em>liquefaction.</em>

			<p> 
				The original stockpiling of material took place in the lowlying basin and edges of Pittsburgh Lake—the northerly most lobe of the much larger Grand Marais that arced through the bottoms in this region. In a common practice, industry saw these ‘unproductive’ and ‘undevelopable’ wetlands as the perfect site for the large-scale storage of waste materials on-site. While current EPA reports note that this site is not hydraulically linked to the adjacent lakes, for anyone with a concern for the underlying ecology of wetlands, this is of course the equivalent of a toxic injection into the bloodstream—with flow gradients and seepage contaminating any waterway in its vicinity.

				The mound today is a clean dome of imported earth—capping the slag material with 2’ of dirt. A 6’ razor wire fence guards the mound, with neat rip-rap ditches limning its edges.

				This colorful heap is composed of the coal combustion waste produced in the former Cahokia power plant just to the south of the mound. With a marbled surface of reds, whites, yellows, and browns, this mound is composed of the fly-ash and other slag produced from burning coal for energy. This mound sits on the river side of the USACE levee—making it subject to inundation. And flood it does. Nearly every year, this mound is worried at by the river’s eddies—dissolving-away its surface and carrying it away downstream. How long, one might ask, until this mound is finally erased by these floods? But while its form may be gradually effaced, its component parts—heavy metals, dioxins, and PAHs—will remain a signal part of the muddy substrata of the river for all time. One of the many contributors to the anthropogenic geological record of the American Bottom.

					What is the threshold for moundness? Such is the question that a researcher of landscape must ask herself. In a topography of subtle ridges and swales, how does a mound enter the field of the legible?
				</p>
				<p> 
					The mounds of the Pulcher Site sit at the north end of Fish Lake—a narrow, long slough that runs for a dozen miles across the length of the bottom. With its backflow from a rising river, the biota of the lake was regularly refreshed with nutrients and biological life. And here, on the eastern edge of the lake and sited on a local high-point known to early settlers as Oklahoma Hill, are a string of remaining mounds. All have been modified by the annual work of agriculture, with the plow regularly working away at their height and redistributing artifacts in the surrounding fields. In certain light, the mounds that make up this site can be read against their agricultural background—with a subtle lift of the ground and its gentle resolution into the furrows.
