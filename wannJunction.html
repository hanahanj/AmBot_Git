		<h2>Wann Junction Disaster</h2>

		<p>
			Standing at the intersection of Main St. and the railroad tracks in East Alton, one could be at a crossing similar to many across the U.S. But here, in 1893, was site to the worst rail disaster in American Bottom history. With tracks owned and operated by an association popularly known as The Big Four, this line also saw use by passenger rail between St. Louis and points to the north. On January 21st, 1893, a 5 car Southwestern Limited train, late and at high speeds to make up for lost time, approached Wann (Alton) Junction where the engineer saw that the rail switch was left open. Immediately pulling the break, there was not sufficient distance to decelerate, and the 5 car passenger train collided with a train carrying 25 oil tank cars. Initially, most of the passengers were not injured. But what followed was a horrendous scene that unfolded in a series of tragic stages. Following the collision, a few of the oil cars spilled their contents, leading in a few moments to the ignition of over 7,000 gallons of oil sprayed across the site, burning dozens of spectators who had gathered after the accident. While numerous people were killed and dozens injured in this explosion, it was not yet the end of the destruction. Thinking this explosion marked the end of the unfolding disaster, people from across the region began to arrive to help those hurt in both the initial accident as well as the first explosion. At a moment of maximum vulnerability, another 5 tank cars, super heated from the nearby fires, exploded—killing 16 and leveling houses, stockyards, and the depot surrounding the junction. 
			<br><br>The rebuilt station in what is now known as East Alton was unceremoniously demolished in July 2006—another of the American Bottom’s historical erasures.
