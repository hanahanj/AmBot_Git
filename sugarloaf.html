			One of the more prominent mounds in the region sits 175’ atop the edge of the bluffs and overlooks the American Bottom. Sugarloaf Mound shares its name with at least 3 other mounds in the region, and was a very common name given to geographic features around the world in the naming frenzy of the 19th century. The mound takes its name from the similarity of shape to the tall, conical lugs of sugar that were sold through the 19th century until the early 20th century when granulated and cubed sugar became more popular. /// As a well recognized local landmark, the US Coast and Geodetic survey decided to piggyback on its visibility and height by locating one of its first-order survey stations atop the mound. Not unlike Clark’s Mound further to the south, the surveyors marked the station with both a surface monument as well as an underground mark—in this case a buried earthenware pyramid. Given the siting of this particular monument on a well known mound, the general description of the mound complexes as America’s “pyramids,” and the common nickname of the American Bottom as “Egypt”, it is hard not to reflect on the formal and philosophical meanings latent in burying a pyramidal shaped vessel 3.5’ into an historic Indian Mound.
