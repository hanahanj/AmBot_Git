			In 1871, surveyors with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey erected a marble survey station on the land of William Clark—on the top of a prominent mound on the bluffs overlooking the American Bottom. The survey monument is a 6in x 6in x 22in white marble pillar, marked with a “+” and inscribed with “U.S.C. and G.S.” (U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey). Surrounding the marble pillar were two, slightly smaller marble reference posts, with arrows inscribed on their top pointing to the primary monument, and three trees—two hickory and one white oak—with triangular blazes arrayed facing the monument. In a practice common at the time, a glass bottle full of ashes, buried 30 inches below ground, additionally marked this point. /// In the rich history of territorial layering and meaning that we find throughout the American Bottom, in 1931 surveyors returned to the site to find that a summerhouse had been built over the spot where the monument was originally located. The house was built by A.T. Spivey, (editor of the East St. Louis Journal and who gave his name to the only skyscraper in downtown East St. Louis), who unfortunately died just weeks prior to the visit by the surveyors. Yet, in the sort of respect rarely shown for historical marks of inhabitation in the American Bottom, the original marble monument was in fat preserved—it now was simply set in middle of the concrete floor of the summerhouse. In 1965, USGS surveyors revisited the monument and found it was still in place—in the middle of the 17’ concrete slab, 6” thick. In the field notes, the surveyors comment that due to this position, verification of the original site by digging up the ash-filled bottle was “practically impossible”, and, anyways, “Since the station is inside the summer house and due to trees on the hill the station is of little value.”
