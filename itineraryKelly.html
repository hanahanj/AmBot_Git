The focus here is on the American Indians who lived and thrived in the American Bottom region of the central Mississippi valley.  People have lived in this region for well over a dozen millennia. As an archaeologist I can measure that distance in the past, however, one must acknowledge that they, in their own words, have always been here.   We must imagine, and this concept is extremely important to this essay, what it must have been for the first people in the “New World” to arrive when it was very cold and a barren landscape in many places.  But once away from the tundra forests appeared much like one would see in parts of Canada.  The Mississippi valley still sliced through the heart of the North American midcontinent, however, vast quantities of water covered the valley from bluff to bluff as the thick ice sheets further north dwindled as the climate warmed.  Plants, animals, and people were responding to these changes.   
			</p>
			
			<p>
The heart of these evolving palimpsests of the environment was the Mississippi river.  Not that everything was dependent upon it, rather it was a force to be reckoned with when it swelled with the rains saturating its basin that extends north into the western Great Lakes and especially northwest where the origins of its largest tributary, the Missouri river, began its life.

I was fortunate a few years ago to see where the Mississippi begins its long journey, a beautiful lush area of forests and lakes.  Like a serpent, the Mississippi meanders south past its meeting with the Illinois river and then  the Missouri.  We can still see remnants of this serpentine course in the abandoned channels such as Horseshoe Lake, Grand Marais, and Goose Lake,  as it extends from one part of the valley floor to the next and back and forth until it gradually reached the Ohio river.  Indigenous people adapted to this lush landscape where they engaged the various forces of the Earth Mother and the spirits that the people envisioned were important sources of power.  Native groups such as the Osage and Omaha referred to this force or power as Wakanda.  Other indigenous people had their own unique word for this force.  Not only was the area rich in food for sustaining life but it   also provided a spiritual sustenance that reinforced their view of the larger cosmos.  A place constantly striving for balance as the world and people would start to teeter.  

			</p>
			
			<p>
The first few millennia after the massive pool of water from the glaciers was gone, people inhabited the landscape focusing on the food resources for maintaining life.  It was not a crowd place.  People could freely move about the landscape not in random or haphazard fashion but one in which they were part of that landscape.  They were in constant rhythm with the seasons and rapidly understood the earth and the creatures that were part of this place

Some six to eight thousand years ago, the warmest period known as the Altithermal resulted in the spread of prairies that extended as a wedge from the eastern slopes of the Rockies east across the Midwest toward the other chain of mountains, the Appalachians.  For the area around St. Louis, especially the higher upland areas called the bluffs, tall prairie grasses and in some areas savannas with trees such as oaks were  scattered across the landscape.  Peoples inhabiting the area adjusted to these changes in the environment. Toward the end of this period of drought we start to see the plant domestication and cultivation with crops such as sunflower, gourd, and squash.  In the latter case its origins were to the south in Mexico. Wild plants and animals remained important in the diets of the people and were still so, when Europeans arrived in the late sixteen hundreds.  The  domestication process, however, more than likely by the women in these societies, demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the plant’s natural properties and the processes effecting certain plants’ reproduction.   

			</p>
			
			<p>
As people became increasing attached to the land that they and their ancestors traversed and less mobile, the death of familial members, a part of the cycle of life, nonetheless, it became important to inter their ancestors as part of this natural cycle.  This resulted in the construction of earthen mounds as sacred blankets to not only cover the deceased but also to honor the ancestors and the landscape upon which they were interred.

			<p>
 Mounds are distributed all across the eastern Woodlands, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Atlantic Ocean to the high prairies of the Great Plains.   In parts of Louisiana the people began as early as 5000 years ago to reshape the landscape with the earth that captured their vision of the cosmos and the world of which they were very much part.  A much larger rendition of these sacred landscapes was created over 3000 years at a place now called Poverty Point in northeast Louisiana.   A series of parallel and nested raised earthen rings form a semi-circle overlooking the broader Mississippi floodplain to the east.  Perhaps the second largest earthen mound in the eastern Woodlands was rapidly constructed at the western apex of this ring.   Rising like a mountain it is a point within this ancient cosmogram that honors the sun’s journey during what we call the equinoxes.  This bird-shaped mound is at a place where the sun sinks below the horizon as darkness descends upon the landscape.  This is the place of death.  It is positioned to balance life and death, but also at that point in the year when the sun will begin its journey south for the winter and north for the summer. Overall this landscape must be viewed as symbolizing their cosmos.  

			</p>

			<p>
Raw materials were obtained from parts of the Eastern Woodlands including the siliceous material, chert, used in fashioning chipped stone implements primarily employed in the hunting of animals along with the cutting and shaping of other organic materials.  The styles of spear points were shared over an area that extended from the western Great Lakes to St. Louis and as far south as Poverty Point.  Although differences existed in other aspects of their material culture, people interacted over a broad area.  The evidence for this interaction included spiritual journeys or pilgrimages to special and sacred places such as Poverty Point, and continued up to and past the point of contact with Europeans for well over three thousand years.  Over this time span, similar places accentuated by large earthen mounds and enclosures were constructed and appeared in different parts of the Eastern Woodlands, including a place today we call Cahokia Mounds.

One of the major changes in region’s environment some five thousand years ago was a shift in the behavior and position of the Mississippi river from a meandering serpent to one that shifted its position to the west side of the valley with a much straighter course often with side channels like braids in the hair, that allowed people to safely travel the river.   However, the earlier meandering had left its mark with numerous abandoned channels that became luxurious lacustrine waters located on a much higher portion of the floodplain, that were not as prone to flooding.
			</p>
			
			<p>
A millennium before Cahokia’s creation, people inhabiting the area were part of an archaeological culture, archaeologists call Middle Woodland.   In many respects Middle Woodland culture was the climax of building earthworks.   Perhaps the most elaborate earthworks were in a portion of the Ohio River valley in the southern part of the state of Ohio.  Covering large portions of the landscape, rectilinear and circular enclosures were connected to each other in a way that represented the union of the cosmos between male and female and the balance achieved.  Most had a lunar orientation that captured the forces of the moon, its association with the feminine side of the cosmos.  While shrouded in the night skies the moon was a powerful force that complimented the sun.  These were societies actively engaged in the cultivation, harvesting, and consumption of native crops.   The people were scattered across the landscape much like the rural farming landscape today, with families residing in small hamlets or villages   The places they created were to establish their place in their vision of the cosmos.

People in the St. Louis region were undoubtedly connected to and visited the ceremonial centers in Ohio.  Throughout the St. Louis region and beyond large mortuary mounds were constructed upon the bluff crests over looking the valley as well as in the valley itself.  As with their cousins in Ohio, people were horticulturalists.   This pattern of plant husbandry continued well after the large earthworks were no longer being constructed.

We will now begin a journey to Cahokia that will take us through various temporal portals.  As we enter one community we exit it through its center eventually reaching Cahokia.  The four or five centuries prior to Cahokia area residents were focused on agriculture centered on native crops.  These crops planted in the spring entailed labor intensive efforts to harvest the seeds in the late spring and fall.  A variety of social and technological changes such as in cooking technology, especially the pots,  paved the way for gradual population increases.   People were dispersed across the floodplain and into the uplands in small settlements, much like in the eighteenth century with the arrival of the French and other immigrants.  Occasional villages appeared.   These small communities remained intact for generally less than a decade. What precipitated their moving is still not clear.  In similar situations historically, this process of abandonment could relate to any number of factors such as the exhaustion of local firewood, decrease in crop yields, even the death of a community member.  Regardless, it was simply a matter of relocating to a nearby landscape that met their needs.  It is estimated, based on excavations, that the population density was approximately 10 people per square kilometer.  There was sufficient space to accommodate any changes in settlement location without any conflict.  
			</p>
	
	
			<p>
To deal with the intensity of harvesting the seed crops presumably all members of a family and the community participated.   Increasing the population numbers may have necessitated women weaning the children at a younger age.  This process would have been enhanced by the nature of the seed crops with which they could prepare gruels that could be fed to infants.  Pots were designed in such a way that they be easily used to prepare these foods.   Regardless, the population did begin to increase within a century or two to a point where it doubled and even tripled from 10 people per square kilometer to 20 and then 30 people square kilometer.   Part of the increase can be attributed to populations once dispersed throughout the floodplain and uplands coalescing on the floodplain and the adjacent bluff.  We can now envision a landscape characterized by small villages, upwards of 50 to 100 people.  Each village was laid out with one of three types of basic plans related to each community’s center.  These were micro-cosmograms that incorporated specific components of the cosmos and society.

For each community a small plaza or community square at the very core had small rectilinear houses distributed around its margins.  At the center of some communities was a small post, an axis mundi.   Such posts were extremely important historically to native peoples and were often at the center of many communities throughout the Eastern Woodlands.    In other communities the post had four rectangular pits arranged in a quadripartite manner.  Four is a sacred number that acknowledges the four sacred directions.   The pits would have contained some of the stored grains, including possibly corn, which had been introduced to an already rich suite of seed cultigens.  Corn does not become a dominant crop until after the end of the twelfth century.  The final plan, which is not as common as the other two, consists of a larger square building.   Historically, the Osage’s sky chief for the upper world moiety came from a sub-clan referred to as the house in the middle.  

			</p>

			<p>
It is important to note that these societies in the region form a complex we call Emergent Mississippian that within a period of less than two centuries marks the transition to Mississippian.  The population continues to increase to a density of 50 people per square kilometer.   By the end of the tenth century the smaller villages had started to nucleate into larger villages covering about 1 ha of area and with populations between 200 and 300 people.  Within a few decades people at these outlying villages surrounding Cahokia rapidly came together at a place we now call Cahokia Mounds.  Their settlements focused on an area about 100-200 meters back from the natural levee bank associated with an abandoned channel of the Mississippi river called the Edelhardt meander.  This occupation stretched from the area of the Woodhenge east at least 400 meters east of Monks Mound.  This area encompassed 17-34 hectares with a possible population between 3 and 7 thousand people.  Why?   Why at this place we call Cahokia?  And How?

			<p>
To grasp what the attraction(s) may have been we must first understand what and how we define what we call Cahokia as a place on the landscape. Toward the end of the eighteenth century a French trading post known as Cantine was operational in the area east of the “Great Knob,” which became known as the Great Cahokia Mound and now Monks Mound.  Originally Cahokia Mounds were called the Cantine Mounds at the beginning of the nineteenth because of the numerous mounds in the vicinity of the trading post.  The largest mound was called the great Cahokia mound because of the Indians living on the first terrace.   Later the Great Cahokia Mound became Monks Mound, named after the Trappist Monks who lived in the vicinity of the large mound for several years shortly after the onset of the nineteenth century. The rest of the mounds in the vicinity of the Monks Mound were then referred to as the Cahokia Mounds.
			
			<p>
				
The boundaries employed to delimit Cahokia are to a large extent arbitrary, as they are with most places what we call “sites.”  How people in the past viewed their places of residence and sacredness have been lost in the midst of time.  This does not preclude our still trying to approximate what might have been.  

			</p>
			

			<p>
We must also understand the nature of the natural landscape, and what aspects stand out.   The Mississippi floodplain, which this is a part, represents a mosaic of contrasts.   The distinct, broad and low lying meander scars I spoke of earlier accentuate the way in which the movement of water in small incised channels and rivulets serve to connect the various parts of the floodplain.  

			</p>
			
		
			<p>
Cahokia’s landscape is draped across an area of the floodplain that includes two abandoned meander scars.   A much older channel known as Spring Lake is superimposed by the more recent Edelhardt meander.   The very center of Cahokia straddled these aquatic features, which were rich in fish and waterfowl and some aquatic plants, especially during the spring and fall periods of migration.   Spring Lake was a more massive area of water, while the Edelhardt served as a low lying basin where Cahokia Creek meandered as it made its way from its source to the north in the upland prairies.  As this serpentine body of water entered the site it moved west and then south where it eventually joined the Mississippi river. At the very heart of the region, Cahokia Creek served as one of the primary transportation routes connecting the numerous towns, villages, and farms, on the bottoms.  Dugouts would have been one of the primary means of transport on the waterways. 
			</p>

			<p>
The other transportation mode was on foot.   Another important component of Cahokia’s location was an extensive and relatively continuous area of “high” ground that followed a geographic area known as “Helms Ridge.”    This area extends from the colluvial fan at the base of the bluffs just east of Cahokia Mounds merging with the natural levee of the Edelhardt meander where Cahokia Creek is located.  This elevated portion of the landscape connects to a portion of the Horseshoe Lake natural levee that extends to an area overlooking the lower terrace of the valley above the lower reaches of Cahokia creek and the Mississippi river. This route coincides with the location of today’s US highway route 40, known as the “National Road.”

		</div>

		<div class = "itinerary_siteText" id="leftAlign">
			<p>
The connectivity by water and land represents an important part of the region’s infrastructure facilitating interaction.   The importance of this transportation infrastructure is enhanced by the area to the south of the Cahokia Creek drainage catchment on the bottoms where a number of superimposed abandoned channel scars, Grand Marais, Goose Lake, have resulted in a vast array of aquatic areas, that while not precluding interaction of Cahokia and its satellite communities with populations to the south, did limit human occupation of this seemingly vast watery world.   

			</p>

	
			<p>
This spatial dissonance in turn resulted in much great social distances.  Hence this resulted in very distinct material differences and those cultural identities extending back several centuries between those living to the north in the Cahokia Creek drainage and those living to the south of Prairie DuPont Creek and the various  oxbow lakes.  This is reflected in the material differences between those communities in the Cahokia Creek drainage area and the area south of the Prairie du Pont drainage that extended back several centuries.   

			</p>	
	

			<p>
Thus one can imagine in the Cahokia locality a series of overland trails that connected many of the larger communities in the region and the water course along Cahokia creek and its tributaries that naturally drained a substantial part of the northern floodplain.  The ease with which people could readily move about the bottom facilitated the ability to access Cahokia and the larger settlements.  Furthermore, the distribution of soils and aquatic resources were such, each community regardless of its size had ready access to most of their subsistence resources.

			<p>
When we turn our attention to the various communities and start with Cahokia in terms of how its inhabitants shaped the natural landscape to accommodate the overall way in which it reflected the cosmos, we began to better conceptualize the site and its configuration.    Today it appears as a static place where we attempt to capture what was.  However, in the past it was a dynamic and fluid landscape of human imagination and interaction.

			</p>
			
			<p>
In the next few paragraphs we can began to see how this place began to rise and literally erupt out of the prairies and watery world were it was immersed.  The seemingly sudden nucleation of population at the outset of the eleventh may very well coincide with the appearance of a bright object just above the horizon of the southeastern skies early in a spring morning of 1006 CE.  Other than the moon it was brighter than any other object in the night sky.  For three years it hovered above the horizon, presumably, a sign to come together.  Perhaps it was this that led to the rapid consolidation of people from villages in the area to Cahokia.   Houses were constructed along Helms ridge from the area where the woodhenge would be built for a distance to the east of nearly two kilometers and extending back from the edge of the Edelhardt meander bank edge for a distance between 100 and 200 meters.   This area of occupation estimated to be between 17 and 34 ha may have accommodated between 3000 and 7000 people.   

			</p>
			
			
			<p>
It was extraordinary!  Houses were constructed and, as in their recently abandoned ancestral villages, were arranged around courtyards and small plazas.  We have no evidence of mounds, although small mounds were being constructed within the region.  We do, however, begin to see the movement of earth in the design and creation of four large plazas that demarcated Cahokia’s epicenter. At the north end of the East Plaza the upper 30-40 centimeters of earth were removed exposing the light colored earth below.   The front of the bank of the natural levee was removed and a terrace was created nearly two meters below upon which houses were built.  We have no indication where the earth removed was destined.   Shortly thereafter a small, less than a meter in height, rectilinear platform mound was erected.  The north face of this small earthen platform extended over the bank covering the filled-in basin of a house that had been constructed on the terrace two meters below.   Other low platform mounds were present within and along the margins of this plaza and it is possible the earth was destined for these places.   At the south end of the plaza a large borrow area was excavated; and then rapidly filled with debris from the preparation of what was an undoubtedly a large feast nearby.

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "itinerary_siteText" id="leftAlign">
			<p>
This borrow pit also extended into the very northeast corner of the Grand Plaza, the southernmost plaza.  Prior to its creation this area was an uneven natural landscape of ridges and swales that the ancient channel of the Mississippi river created over 5 thousand years ago as part of the Spring Lake meander to the east.  Remnants of the more sandy ridges still can be seen outside of the Grand Plaza.  It was here that the tops of the sandier ridges were truncated with the earth deposited into the adjoining low-lying clayey swells.  This level landscape was then accentuated as a sunken plaza by creating platforms of earth to the east, south, west, and north.  The easternmost platform covered the borrow pit and eventually a mound was constructed upon its summit.  In this way the four sacred directions played a role in shaping this landscape.  Now the plaza was visually and symbolically lower.   

			</p>
			
			<p>
What we readily see today are the pairing of mounds around the plaza’s periphery placed in opposition and reflecting the basic geometric forms of the circle and the square.   Throughout Cahokia the square is on the east or south and the circle compliments this shape on the west or north, respectively.  If we peer below the large rectilinear Murdock mound at the south end of the east row of mounds excavations have uncovered structures placed in the same relative position.  These shapes reinforce basic principles of duality that underscore the balance achieved within the universe.    The lowest piece of architecture in this sequence is a cross-shaped house placed within a circular basin.  Moreover we can easily see in some instances the pairing of big with little.  

			</p>
			
			

			<p>
If we turn our attention to the West Plaza, its leveling was not as massive as the Grand Plaza and was comparable to what was occurring with the creation of the East Plaza.   Again we see the pairing of mounds that delineate three of the plaza’s sides.   The northern margin of the plaza was open to the swampy wetlands to the north that symbolized the watery underworld of their cosmic model.   Unlike the East and Grand Plaza where a few mounds were placed within the plaza, none are evident in the West Plaza.  Instead large circular and rectangular enclosures were placed at the north end of the plaza that formed a north-south axis through the plaza’s center.    This architectural sequence begins with a series of large circular enclosures.   Then one of the large square enclosures with small circular rooms along its outer walls is paired with a large circular rotunda.   Along this axis to the south four large poles rising some twenty feet into the sky were placed to honor each of the four sacred directions at the plaza’s center.

			<p>
The North Plaza located on one of the lowest areas of the natural landscape within the channel of the abandoned Edelhardt meander is accentuated by the placement of four mounds at the four cardinal sides of the plaza.  Some evidence exists that this plaza was raised so it stood above the surrounding wetlands.   

			</p>

			<p>
At the very center of this tableau of spatial architecture was Monks Mound.  However, its construction rapidly occurred after the four plazas had been established.  The landscape upon which Monks Mound was constructed was the site’s architectural and cosmological axis mundi.   Monks Mound once underway was to a large extent constructed of earthen materials derived from the meander scar to the north.   These massive depressions that the extraction of earth would have made were no longer visible.  Because the abandoned channel was a basin where sediments from the Cahokia Creeks periodic flooding began rapidly accumulating over the millennia.  These creative events, taking place throughout much of the eleventh and into the twelfth century, were to a large extent associated when ground water was naturally lower and people were able to occupy much lower portions of the bottoms.   This would not necessarily be considered a drought as it could be argued that the rains were very timely and did not cause any flooding. Midway through the thirteenth century, however, the Mississippi river exploded across the valley creating a massive lake.

In the construction of Monks Mound we can see symbolism in its rectangular shape and its position on landscape to the east where it is juxtaposed against the circular series of monumental post circles known as the woodhenges nearly a kilometer to the west.   Consisting of five large sequentially built circles of posts, the initial woodhenge, with its circular array of large upright posts.  Some 15 feet in the air, with a central post from which one could observe the rising and setting of the sun at the solstices and the equinoxes.  The remaining posts that made up the circle whose diameter would have enclosed one of our modern football fields were systematically placed at set distances.

There was a history to this place, nearly 1 km from Monks Mound.  This was a residential area for nearly a century tied to the city’s beginnings.  Within this place of the living was an area in which large axes were produced.  Ironically the place of their production was the also where the winter solstice sunrise post was erected.  It is also the approximate location of where the supernova would have suddenly appeared in the southeastern sky a century earlier.  A major juxtaposition of life in the birth of the supernova, and death with the sun’s appearance in the winter dawn occurred here.

One must realize that the architecture of mounds and large buildings constructed in the eleventh century did not obstruct the view of the sun rising in the east.   Monks Mound was probably built rapidly built after that inaugral sighting of the sun and the sun at the equinoxes would later be seen rising out of Monks Mound’s south face.

As Monks Mound was completed in the early part of the twelfth century a large building, some 100 feet long by nearly 50 feet wide, was constructed at the north end of its summit.  The large wall posts were placed in trench excavated to a depth of 3 feet and a series of large poles were aligned along the center axis to support a massive horizontal ridge pole.  The building’s height added another 40 feet to the top of Monks Mound.    In front of the building a large pole was erected in a large hole that was 15 feet in depth and the pole arose above the roof of the building and could readily capture the forces that erupted around the mound during the spring and summer.  It was in the top of the pole where the thunderer’s resided.     This building at the center of the site may have been a metaphor for the sub-clan, “the House-in-the-middle” of the Sky Chief, which several centuries earlier was at the center of certain villages.

By the end of the twelfth century something happened.   A large palisade was  constructed to enclose Cahokia’s most sacred elements, Monks Mound and the Grand Plaza.   People were mobilized to construct a wooden wall with circular bastions at regular distances along the wall.  A wall was also erected at the center of the ancient East St. Louis town and the residential area outside was set afire.  People rapidly dispersed! Some were able to construct temporary shelters within the walls at the town’s center. Items that may have been possible weapons were left behind suggesting they may have been driven from here as well.  The only possible force that could have overrun East St. Louis was Cahokia.   The picture is very unclear.

Nonetheless, we begin to see other actions being taken at this time.  The building on the summit of Monks Mound was abandoned, removed, and symbolically buried.   We see similar activity associated with many of the other larger mounds as they were being turned into monuments.    The woodhenge monuments to the west were no longer being rebuilt and by the beginning of the thirteenth century this area had reverted back to a small residential area.  The Powell area precinct on the western margins of the site was essentially abandoned.   Although the population at Cahokia and the region had been cut in half by the beginning of the thirteenth century Cahokia remained the largest Mississippian town as the Mississippian world began to explode on the scene further south and east.

In addition to building the palisade Cahokians began to add a large terrace on to the south face of Monks Mound and a small mound was placed at the southwest corner of the mound with a sequence of temples being constructed on its summit.   Outside the palisade wall a new plaza complex was constructed.   Second in size to the Grand Plaza, the newly created Ramey plaza was constructed from earth obtained from a residential area to the north of the plaza.   Earthen platforms serve to accentuate the plaza and its sunken nature some 4 to 5 feet below the surrounding landscape.   Today as one drives through the subdivision superimposed on the east half of the plaza, one encounters a major bump in the road that drops into the plaza.   This bump is part of an earthen berm extending along the north edge of the plaza and excavated to create the sunken plaza to the south.  A series of mounds were placed along the north edge. On the west the platform was constructed with earth that caps a sacred landscape of special buildings including a copper workshop and upon which rectangular earthen mounds were erected.   However, between the completion of the platform and the mound building a massive flood occurred throughout the valley.  A massive deposit of silts and sands from the Mississippi River extended across the top of the platform sealing off the surface.

This flooding occurring in the early to mid thirteenth century was the first clear evidence of a catastrophic event evident not only at Cahokia but also in the surrounding region.   When time of the year did this occur? And how did it affect the people?   The most likely time to occur would have been the spring.   Undoubtedly the taller mounds, those over 5 to 10 feet and above, would have stood above the waters.   Whether people would have had access to them is uncertain.   After the flood we do know that Mound 34 was completed, and a large building perhaps 35 to 40 feet square would have highlighted the summit.  It would have been the place in which rituals related to hunting and warfare were conducted.  Again something devastating took place, the building burned.  It is unclear whether this was intentional; an act of aggression on the part of others; or perhaps the building was struck by lightening and burned.   Regardless, this event necessitated the removal of the building’s architectural elements and with the contents they were deposited over the sides and onto an earthen terrace below, and then the capping of the summit as a final act of symbolic burial thus creating a monument.

By the end of the thirteenth century Cahokia became an altogether different place.   Mounds were no longer being constructed and the existing mounds had become earthen monuments.   The West plaza, a residential area in the early thirteenth century was abandoned after the flood.   It was later reoccupied by the beginning of the fourteenth century and continued as a large residential area until the site’s abandonment later in the fourteenth century.  Cahokian society had reverted back to a tribal society and this may have been the onset of the ethnogenesis of groups such as the Quapaw and Osage, undoubtedly some of whom were descendants of the original society.

Some four centuries later in January 1810, Henri Marie Brackenridge  traveled to Cahokia from the small town of St. Louis.   His journey by horse took him across the Mississippi on the Wiggins  ferry that docked at Illinoistown, today located near East St. Louis’s Higher Education Center.   Once he reached the higher ground he climbed the highest mound in the East St. Louis mound group where he saw in the prairies around him an estimated 45 to 50 earthen mounds that formed a large semicircle that opened upon and faced Cahokia Creek to the west.    His journey along the ancient trail led him to the Cantine Mounds where the Trappist Monks had settled around the Great Knob.  Again climbing to the top of the Great Knob he could easily count over 60 mounds in the surrounding prairies.   This must have been an impressive panorama that excited the imagination of not only Brackenridge but also others even today.
